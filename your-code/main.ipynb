    "There are many different approaches that we can take when creating recommender systems. In the Intro to Recommender Systems lesson and lab, we put together a user similarity based recommender that first calculated the similarities between users and then leveraged a rank-based item recommender within each group of similar customers. In other words, for a given user, our recommender found the top 5 customers who were the most similar to them, aggregated and ranked the purchases of those 5 customers, and then recommended the top 5 most popular products among that group of similar users to the customer.\n",
